          We are a research group at Aalborg University attempting to break new ground in the field of gesture
          recognition, and we need your data to do so. We will collect data such as your age, gender, fitness as well as
          record your arm / wrist while you do different gestures. That is to say, we will <strong>not</strong> collect
          any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address etc. <strong class="bg-danger">By participating in
          our data collection, you agree to have your data shared in a public datset.</strong> We share the data such that our
          results may be reproduced and improved upon in the future.
